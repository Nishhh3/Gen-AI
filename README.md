# Gen-AI

The Personal Fun Facts Generator App is a fun, interactive web application that generates random "fun facts" about the user. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to apply the concepts of prompt engineering, context setting, and handling AI limitations (hallucinations) learned in GenAI 101.
